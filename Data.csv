Starbucks 'barista': constantly judging you. Street food guy: more open minded than you would have imagined.
My local Kebab guy is easily one of the coolest and nicest guys in the entire town. I'd honestly count him as one of my best friends in the town and I don't even know his name (I've narrowed it down to two different options)
Kebab guy there for you at 1 in the morning after a late shift and every other place is closed.
Kebab guy works for himself of course he's happy and he's the actual boss
"Bro, Boss, Chief and I've had a couple of "Effendim" which I think is buddy or friend. I've only ever had a bad experience in one Kebab shop and I never went there again, that one has since closed but the others are still going strong."
"I had the best kebab guy in Prague at my last work. I always gave him extra money and he made portion bigger or threw an extra baklava in. After some time he left the place. When i visited my ex in the other city, she said that they have new kebab hous… See more"
"Apart from Humour , the difference between small private businesses and big evil corporations, we need to eat more from Kebab guys and drink more from the private bars."
Dude literally calls me boss!
This reminds me when I went to Turkey few years ago and the kebab man there didn’t even let me pay for my order which I ordered a lot. I kept insisting but he wouldn’t take it he said cause he heard me saying this is my first time trying out kebab tha… See more
Employed  vs self-employed.
It’s so true! My local “bab”
"Iv fought on my kebab mans behalf, got dropped but the delivery guy gave me a spin home as thanks."
Shawarma is the finest dish on the earth
Döner guy says that he made an extra favor for you.
Kebab guy own his business Starbucks employees need to tally the cash at closing and there is camera company will not liable for Custm but the employees can lose his job for kindness now think twice
"Kebab guys are awesome. Everywhere around the world, kebab kiosks are the places where cultures meet, filled with respect, great food and good conversations. And they never expect tips, just doing their honest work, feeding the working class people that really need it."
"I haven't met a Starbucks barista (or a kebab guy for that matter) who's not nice. What I can't stand are the so-called "independent" cafes, restaurants and delis with their hidden "discretionary" service charges. I've confronted a few of them in the p… See more"
This is purely the mindset because at Starbucks you see Employees and Kebab guys are mostly the owners.... Business is good or bad employees get the salary (in the short term) but the circumstances are different for the owners who run the show...
"calling you boss is marketing. I have seen homeless people who calls you boss when they ask for money, but they change attitude fast if you don't give them any"
"For you my friend, I give extra"
"Ahahahahahah I'm amazed by the "Boss" thing since it's the same here in France, always calling you "Chef" wich means the same. There must be a World Kebab Academy somewhere"
Kebab guy is his own boss in a local and well loved businesses.  Starbucks girl makes minimum wage for an evil corporation.
""For you, I put extra""
"The local kebab guy calls me "buddy," so I know I got a real one!"
the starbucks is 100% accurate LOL
"All true. Also, a few times when my missus had short of any ingredient during cooking and we had a kebab shop downstairs, she came and asked for one and Bossman always gave her short stuff for free. Respect your local Bossmans."
Calls you brother so often you don't even care how much you have to pay because you feel the money stays in the fam
The best kebab guys call you "kardeş" or "patron." #Türkiye
"Kebab guy, when i forgot the wallet, he trust me will pay tomorrow"
Here in Belgium they call you Chef
Because in eastern culture we are homely and hospitable and we always feed our guests
"No to mention, she's AI... not real"
Well kebab guys tell and say what you wanna hear atleast the Starbuck people are more honest
"I used to know a kebab guy, he was chill, we even went to some party together one time, and at the crack of dawn we went back to his store and he made the most perfect kebabs while both of us being drunk AF. Core memory."
The Kebab guy sometimes calls you Bro as well ))
"Starbucks baristas always offer upselling without saying it will be an extra charge. If customers don't want it, they will be in a bad mood, haha"
"Well, most of the kebab guys don't work for corporate.. starbucks' employees all do.."
somtimes he call us chef also
Spells your name wrong is so correct
How can a meme be so AI generated like this…
I miss snack packs
"Most cafes just have a jar that says tips on it that you can easily just ignore - if I am paying £2.50 for a cup of coffee anyway I’m not tipping, margins on coffee is absolutely mental."
Kebab guy will ALWAYS be the GOAT!
i was pissed off when the kebab guy called someone else boss in a front of me
Starbuck employe = salary
"Kebab guy is like El Taquero in my country, only he will always call you "Guero" even if you´re not one"
2 of the kabab plazes where i live has so rude bosses It feels rude foe order. But the rest is very nice.
I don't see the comparison between them . but both of them are average to me
After selling kebab same guy goes to pro hamas rally.
you should be boycotting starbucks anyway.
Kebab is life  never had a bad kebab meal.
"In good kebab store, EVERYONE addresses each other as “Boss!”"
Because he knows what's in the 'meat' he's giving you...
"if you;re loyal to one kebab guy ..then sometimes i get a free drink if he hears you,re a foreigner in England or Netherlands for example"

That's why in Poland and Germany there are so many kebab's guy's
Kebap restaurants in Turkey.
In france we say "maitre kebabier" and they call us "chef"
Starbucks: charges you $13 for a large cup of half ass made coffee
"One is an employee, the other one is a boss"
"It’s his restaurant, your payment goes in his pocket"
Difference is that Kebab guy is same time the business OWNER while starbucks employee is soy liberal who hates everything and everyone but works in there because company is also "liberal" and he thinks he makes world better place by dooing so
"kebab guy: leases the truck, has to purchase everything from the cartel: nets almost zero."
Kebab guys are always smiling bc they are enjoying their job
Kebab guy owns his own business while starbucka lady is the employee
That’s discrimination. Kebab guys deserve to get the acknowledgment of doing it just for the money too
Kebab guy will give you alot of meats to worth for what you are paying for.
So that he calls you boss is common in other countries too?
The difference is kebab guy owns his shop so he loves his work and Starbucks are employees so doesn't care about works can shift wherever they want
I’d say this is 100% accurate
Starbucks always whrite wrong also a simple name tho
"The employee aint getting no money down her pocket and is on hourly rate, the kebab guy will do that for customer as its all down his pockets hahaha"
Always tip the kebab man!
Kebab guy truthfully and sincerely calls me Mr. Handsome
Loyal to his wives
Boss or habibi and either one hits just right before and or after the shawarma
Except their bully ice cream seller though
that's why i dont use to visit a starbucksh1t
Stood in line for my coffee and I have to TIP?!?  That's a scam.
Starbucks employee: she don't know what is in your coffe
Because one is owned by a corporation and one is a small business
All of them wants money!
Or call me “brother”
Doesn't ask for tips
Kebab guy doesn't care a shit if you're happy or not. Worst kebab in town.
Starbucks barista: what's your name sir?
I would always choose the Kebab shops!
He always call u "güerito"
"Sometimes it is the other way around because the Starbucks employee is paid by the hour so can give a genuine smile whereas if the kebab guy owns the business, he is happy he is getting your money, so will definitely be happy with you because you are g… See more"

Family owned chain vs conveyor belt organisation
"My local Starbucks baristas rule. I sell them weed, they sell me coffee. It's a good system."
What about the local khlav kalash guy

"Approve, that it is."
I love you Kebabibi
"heres some extra sauce boss - HAWK TUAH"
But he make kid
"Ever seen a normal person work at Starkbucks? No, they all either look weird, dress weird, or talk weird."
You’re suppose to tip at Starbucks?!
""Ahh it's okay brother, you will pay tomorrow don't worry""
Is kebab guy  calls you boss or brother?
Kebab guy you go for beer after shift and have the time of your life too
Both are unhealthy
I think the starbucks employees are friendly
Accurate. They also write it wrong
Passive aggressive
Kebab guy for the win!
Even kebab guy call me "My Friend"
U can eat even though u don’t have money
Bring it on
"I make my own coffee, cheers."
"Know your value, being in the right place"
Bet the kebab guy doesn’t get asked stupid orders like baristas do
Best food and nicer owner in Germany
Turkish people are happy people
Both are fake smiles
Kebabies are the most badass guys you will meet
Also cup of coffe for 7€ vs large kebab for 7€
Haven't heard of any Starbucks cafe having late night grooming meet ups
Starbucks EMPLOYEE
Simple.....he can drink at work.
"Kebab connection, connected people"
Why call him kebab Guy why not kebab chef ?
For you. I give extra
Keep your residence…
The woman on the left laughs like at smile
true
Global vs local
For you...... I give extra
"My favorite food, Kebab."
Unless youre jewish
that one time he calls me captain
Fact man even I’m going to pickup doordash delivery.
Vaqif Əli aglima 3 is free geldi hahaha
"Or the kebab guy calls you,  friend. Just go visit Shelby's Canada . You have have to experience it."
Wait what Neil De Grass is doing at Kebab shop?
Chicken Cottage over Starbucks any day all day.
Kebab guys don't care because they are running a front to launder money
I think they gonna cry Starbucks
true
why grasseaters hate kebab guy... Kabab guy is nice person...he feeds his whole family by that small shop with a smile... He is not greedy like Starbucks BOD who suck on the blood of employees by selling free wifi and cheap coffee ... And selling your data
Boycott Starbucks
Kebab guy called me "Big Boss" one time
"It's like with dogs and cats, they attract different people. If you want to be a slave, you get a cat and do Starbucks. If you want to feel superior, get a dog and a kebab"
How stupid u must be to get ur coffee at starbucks
"Our local coffee shops are better, screw SBucks"
I don’t think so
Patrick Brown this is why I always suggest kebabs
Definitely
Starbucks
I guess what is trying to be sold to me is that i need the loyalty of a kebab guy hehe
He pay no tax
Sorry but this is quite unfair. Personally I know Starbucks employees who are genuinly nice people. You cannot judge the employees because the company appears to you as nasty. Employees are not cloned beings and we have all types of personalities among… See more
yeah but the other day i see the kebab guy listening CALM LIKE A BOOM from P.O.D
"In Germany they call you "Chef" (which literally means Boss..); BUT, only in the little privately owned Kebab places!"
"they really do judge people , even people who drink them judges, if you order less than 20 bucks, you are broke to them"
He is using the same meat as last week. Real smile.
Kebab it is !
Kebabs now a tenner  no wonder he’s smiling
Gives you extra thummia  on top
Same thing happens in Japan. Street chicken was the
"“For you, I put extra.”"
Kebab guy probably owns the food truck which is the difference
Feross Salame
In my country Kebab sellers treat really bad their clients.
Boycott?
But Starbucks don't give ya the shitz lol
Brantley Brooks
My kebab guy don't smile
Shit coffee or succulent kebabs? The choice is easy.
Local kebab dont smile
God bless the kabob man.
Kebab guy knows more about and hates ZOG more than you do.
"He’s a Gus guy, not Kebab."
That barista has a 120K student loan to pay off for her 'education' in gender studies. So can you just give her a break already.....
And Also Starbucks overpriced and support violence in middle east
Starbuck employe "plss some tip"
Facts but to be fair Kebab guy owns the place. Starbucks barista just works there.
You guys make it complicated…. Beside prepared meat… who do not smile????

That Kebab guy always calling me "Boss you again! want more spicy sauce?!"
Because she is an employee and he is an employer
Nope just as fake as the Starbucks person
Danille Datario
They also help fund a genocide
"Kebab is actually delicious with pretty reasonable price, Starbucks is overpriced mid at best coffee"
"Since I was a child, I had a dream to open a kebab restaurant. I would treat everyone with a smile. Kebab is a daily meal in our house, so we have expertise in kebab. But sadly, my dream remained a dream."
Starbucks employee has university degree in gender studies and thinks everyone else is stupid.
Welcome to Europe!
I have my fav kebab shop in my town and that boss is just like my bro.
For you I put extra: Kebab guy
I like kebab guy
Starbucks employee: looks at me like I'm trash
How about the forced tip for the kebab guy?
Kebab guy: Doesn't wash his hands. Sylas his wife at home.
Always kebab guy
"Hey, those shawarma slap! And the Arab-style coffee at my neighborhood kebab stand easily beats the pants off Starbucks any day!"
Kebab is overrated garbage.
Dumb comparison
That's
For u I put extra
Facts

300 liras brother
Kebab is supremacy
Kebab guy win
Literally
Hats off to the boss man!
Thats shawarma.
Habibi
Benjamin Chew

Left = supports Genocide
Another propaganda post to sell dead bodies
She’s working minimum wage and probably isn’t a terrorist
True that.
kebab is loyal? they will share you with 3 other womens. loyal in your dream
"Plus, Starbucks supports genocide Zionist entity in Occupied Palestine."
kebab real gastroenteritis !!
That's true.
He was too old for her then
People still convert youtube to mp3??
i prefer FLACSs from [redacted]
"He was a punk, she did ballet?"
I'm YT music Venced Boy
"I used to be the left now I'm the right, talk about growth"
I need this flipped

Youtube actually holds higher fidelity files than spotify
"I actually still collect cd's. They're more convenient to play in my car, I like the physical packaging, ripping them allows me to have my own library that's not dependent upon a subscription, and finally I just enjoy the process of collecting them."
Literally filled up an MP3 player with music ripped from YouTube. YT just has every song ever made.

torrenting discographys while thinking of the pizza that shouldve been here 10 mins ago.
I like having my music available at any time so I always downloaded with yt to mp3
The pirates life is a life for me
I feel called out
"I probably YouTube to MP3’d a 1,000 songs way back when"
YouTube to MP3 for local files because Spotify doesn't have everything available. That is the proper way.
….. you all know soulseek exists right
He's too good for for. He deserves better.
"I have Spotify premium, and if there’s a version of a song I want, I use YT to MP3 and add the downloaded song to Spotify with the “add local files” feature. Thank Spotify for that feature, now I can listen to the live version of butterflies by Liana Flores ^^"
"I have Spotify and there's tons of music missing, they only have mainstream music and "great value" proprietary music"
So he's 20 years older?
soundcloud
That moment when you have been both in both ways in your lifetime
"So, he breaks the law, and she makes poor financial decisions"
So happy the left isn't necessary anymore
He doesn't deserve her.
What is Limewire?
These still exist? Or was this an outdated meme template
Youtube was the only place I could find that obscure brain dead music with around a thousand views
"but then,,, he uploads the mp3 to her Spotify"
Bro  is a lucida.to ripper
I was both.
"I used to convert YouTube videos to mp3s until the converter I used converted the files in such a way that my bluetooth mp3 player couldn't play them. I only got Spotify Premium because I did, in fact, want a break from the ads."
Hi-res digital/vinyl folks:
Me being a limewire guy
They took a midnight train going to yt music!
I WAS BOTH
"But fr though, who still converts their songs to mp3? unless you're using it to listen to when you're out of internet, then that's pretty understandable, but if you've got internet connection and you still convert your favorite songs to mp3, what's the… See more"
I did YouTube to mp3 and burned cds yea
Still his music taste better
And here i thought i was special and one of the only ones doing youtube to mp3
"I took the new bluetooth unit out of my car to install one from the 90s, its cd and mindisc. I also spent $100 for an aux system for it... not that I use it  I just rip music off of cds, burn them onto new cds and in the car they go."
Is it weird to be both?
I’m a MEGA boy for all my unreleased shiii
"I use YT music premium, is Spotify really that good, for me YT quality is good when I switch video to audio sound quality got improved in YT music so I never give a try on another app. So someone please tell me should I switch or not"
I've built a collect of music on my PC for the last 26 years.
I laugh at people who pay for Spotify. Either support your artists and buy their music or convert to mp3 if you're too poor to do so.
This is too real
She got that desperate grip on the lad.
I couldn't find a song on Spotify the other day and it made miss YouTube converter
I was a format factory boy
All of my songs were downloaded using YTMP3 lmao
me in middle school vs me in high school
"Naaahh, it's 'He was on Pirate Bay, She hacked Lime wire away, they couldn't get the viruses gone in enough time'"
I downloaded all my favorite YouTube videos back in the day. I didn't always have internet.
I just do YT Premium and my YT Music with it. It's such a good service plus no ads on my TV app.
I miss the days of [acquiring] massive libraries of music and chucking em all on a dedicated mp3 player.
When she is richer then you
Spotify is missing a lot of the music I like
I was a Napster boy.
Don't ever play music in my car
Lime wire ftw
"Literally true of my relationship rn. Though, I still burn and rip stuff quasi legally"
I prefer spotify. Has helped me discover so many great bands.
Yall really don’t realize this is a whole age gap joke saying he is in his late 20s she’s in her late teens early twenties
I'm both...There's some sweet remixes on YouTube.
676 songs I downloaded
So what is this(?
Is this the alt right pipeline everyone talks about?
And I'm a modded Spotify
Most of the songs are still not on Spotify and not all of them will be.
Both of them have helped aided into the decline of musical creativity.
Makes sense for Denji since he was poor
I'm a YouTube &gt; MP3 boy but I need a YouTube &gt; MP3 girl
I am YouTube premium boy add songs to playlist and listen
Some seriously rocking songs aren’t on Spotify. I still do the YT to mp3 for songs not on Spotify
He was a “Spotify premium” boy and she was a “Youtube premium” girl
I'm more of a download off the Internet extract the files from the zip and put all of it on my SD card I ain't got time for all that ra da bullshit
"Does you.magictube still exist, one sec"
Ahh those were the days
he was [spotify mod apk premium] BOY
The story of my marriage.
He is a PIRATE
I still do be using sound cloud
"I've been through the gauntlet. Went from downloading entire discographies on bittorrent (while buying undiscovered artist's albums on iTunes), to just giving up and using Spotify. Many nights spent correcting file names and adding album art for my iPod."
It’s free. I convert all the time on YouTube. I go to an mp3 converter website. It’s so cheap and easy
I'm a youtube to mp3 guy
"Shi here I am doing both, I mainly only download music when I wanna throw something on a MD"
He’ll yea dis hit hard
That's because men are willing to put in the effort
I was a Spotify premium mod APK
I miss burning CDs
True I always download the songs from snaptube lol
I was a dos to midi type of guy myself
I have about a gig of music on my phone that's exactly this
"Why in heavens would anyone still download music to listen to, I'm discovering new music all the time on Spotify, downloading that much music would be a job itself."
This sounds like a very large age gap to me
"is it weird that there's me who uses both Audiomack and YT music to flip through an album, then proceeds to Vidmate to download the tracks i fuck with?"
I like to have the actual files. there's no ads or buffering that way.
YT to Mp3 was peak when it was a simple app on your iPhone 4s
I'm the both
"One gets and listens to music they actually want to hear, one paid for music they don't get to choose."
yup that is what i alway do for the case i don't have wifi i still can listen the music without internet
What more is there to say?
Physical media is better than all.
How do you guys do that from youtube to mp3?
I’m a MUSI MAN. (Poor man youtube)
Me with my YouTube music and him with his Apple play. We both have Apple but Apple just doesn’t know me like YouTube does.
Im both i only use the premium free month so i can usd roadtrips  but notmally i am the boy( i use flvto)
Me and bro with Spotify mods

"Shiiit ... just gona trow it thier  too, he ps she pc,"
Nice to see another brother still practicing the ancient ways.
What if I’m both?
I can't find the India helicopter song in spotify but YouTube find it
I definitely don't illegally download all my music from YouTube
"Nah, then why's he holding her hand? I bet she even has an iPhone and makes fun of his android"
Boy deserves respect
I just buy music.
I feel like way too many people don't understand what the guy is actually doing with Youtube and music and I feel so sorry for you.
In my defense I don’t have to search for the unedited version on Spotify
She only wants him to pay for that subscription
Grouped with Vidmate and moved on to SnapTube
"I was both, as well as YMusic"
Guess I'm intersex because I did both.

Can I make it anymore obvious?
Kinzli Stallings she was a Pandora girl

YouTube Premium is better than both though I was the dude at some point
I Love This
"fellows, am I the only one who take youtube to mp3, and import to my phone or archive as CD / USB and play it in my car?....."
Well.... she's better be with someone who is a Spotify_premium_mod_APK.

It's a transition timeline
Remember limewire? Fuck I'm old.

"I am a boy but I'm rich , I do prefer Spotify"
3 month offer of Spotify hahaha
My bf and I are the opposite lol
So it's an age gap relationship
Both
Youtube convreter allday
I don't see the reason to use spotify whe youtube has everything spotify has
"Downloading mp3s is based, you can import them to FL Studio mobile and change the pitch+playback speed and customize your EQ+Reverb etc."
"Nah, shoulda been limewire boy tbh"
He was a Dj?
"So if you use the lime wire, does that mean you are autistic"
Just download revanced smh
Real
Does Drake have a chance?
i only use snaptube to download music from youtube links hehe
Other way around... iv had Spotify for over 14 to 15 years
I don't get why people pay for Spotify Premium when you can download music from Youtube for free. You have a bigger selection too.
I'm a girl
me using mods
. . . I'm confused. Could you make it more obvious?
Jae Pilkington  we've been 30000% called OUT
Real ones use soulseek
I have spent probably 24 hours collectively coverting music to MP3s.
That exactly describes me and my partner Evie Handtke
YouTube music is awesome
Use Spectify if you are using PC
And I am a Spotify crack user boy
Me boy:
What app yall use to convert
She was a fairy
im use apple music
This is a transition timeline
Bandcamp has better audio quality
Brett but apple music
I have a lot of respect for YouTube to MP3 guys. They don't give a cent to satanic illuminati pedophiles.
I be converting yt to mp3 to sample songs in fl studio
Limewire? ... Anyone? ...
I am: single forever
I just found my old YouTube concert playlist from 13 years ago
Could they make a Dyson Sphere together?
Mp3 solo can download music and play offline
He was a pirate
Yes keep talking
Could be us
youtube revanced exists
people who use discord:
The accuracy.
Vanced/Revanced/Revanced Extended team :
he was a soulseeker
"Converting from YouTube to mp3's? Man's got no standards at all. Deemix, Rutracker and Soulseek exist, come on get some quality maaan"
Yep that's me
"He did work, she had everything handed to her"
"im a, use a jailbroken iphone 4 as your main mp3 player type of guy."
yt downloading is the way to go!
Doesn't she want more music
"I use both. When a song on Spotify is REALLY good, I youtube it and download the mp3. Or when it isn't on Spotify. I've begun thinking about "life after streaming services", after all you own nothing and if they were to shut down you'd lose everything."
Y'all never rawdogging spotify free?
Bruh its 2025 just send the link to a telegram bot and it will send u the mp3 file ready to download
I’m both
How'd u know
I fuckin hate the songs Spotify loves to throw on my playlists. I’ll listen to new material when I fucking feel like it. Don’t jam random songs into my shit bro.
This is makima ?
"&gt;google music was superior, all it lacked was dark mode"
I'm a boy now
Guess I’m a girl now

'Can they make it any more obvious?'
Wait is this not a transition timeline
"He was a boy, she was a girl. Can I make it anymore obvious?"
I remember when I could just google IronMaiden.rar and instantly get full albums.
Apple music ftw
Where he at tho
"He's based.  I mostly do YouTube music, but sometimes I do his method."
"If it wasn’t so slow, it would’ve been so much better"
Why is this so accurate
Poor/rich gotcha
I feel legitimately called out &lt;.&lt;
Apple music sound quality is better than both
Both with No personality at all
Yt to mp3 will forever be the go to method.
Soulseek ftw
"MP3, but good quality (320kbps)"
Both are horrible ways to get music
